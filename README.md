### covid-19 related webscraping project. <br>
<br>

The `covidSraper.py` script scans the following website: `https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/county-county-breakdown-positive-cases`
and saves the tabulated data in a `.csv` file located in  `/covidData` folder. The `covidScraper.sh` can be used for automatization e.g. in a crontab.
